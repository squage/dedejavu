We probably all know the feeling of having experienced something before, or in programming, writing something similar before, so here are some packages with some functions I have repeatedly used myself. And I will be adding more over time.

Also serves as a small enough project to be used as illustration and code sample.

Builds on earlier helper functions and tools. Now setup more properly as package.
